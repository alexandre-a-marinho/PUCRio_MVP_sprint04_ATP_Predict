## External API access
This Frontend is making direct access to an external API that provides monetary exchange rates [https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/dashboard].
The required access key is embedded in the code, so the usage is transparent to the user.

Attention!!! Depending on your browser http protocol configuration, it may not work properly because the API's free access
key does not provide https access, only http. If your browser is configured to force https connection even when a http connection is required, then the connection will fail. So please adjust your browser accordingly.
Firefox browser has this configuration turned off by default and is the safest alternative (avoid Chrome and Edge).

## How to run (Docker mode)

Be sure to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and in execution in your machine.

Once the image is created, to run the container simply execute, **as administrator**, the following command:
